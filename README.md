# Frontend Mentor - Shortly URL shortening API Challenge

![Design preview for the Shortly URL shortening API coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

This is a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions).
The challenge was to build out a landing page, integrate with the [shrtcode API ](https://app.shrtco.de/) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## Solution

The page is done in React, using Sass with BEM naming. <br>
